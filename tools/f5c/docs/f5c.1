.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a set of base\-called nanopore reads and associated raw signals, f5c call\-methylation detects the methylated cytosine at genomic CpG cites and f5c eventalign aligns raw nanopore signals (events) to the reference k\-mers\. f5c can optionally utilise CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics cards for acceleration\. f5c is a heavily re\-engineered and optimised implementation of the call\-methylation and eventalign modules in Nanopolish\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-cuda\-mem\-frac FLOAT\fR:
.
.br
Fraction of free GPU memory to allocate [default value: 0\.9 for non\-tegra GPUs and 0\.7 for tegra GPUs]\. On GPUs with dedicated RAM (e\.g\., GeForce, Tesla and Quadro) almost all available free GPU memory can be allocated\. A slightly lower value such as 0\.9 is preferred instead of 1\.0 to prevent unexpected crashes\. In GPUs with integrated memory shared with RAM (e\.g\., Tegra GPUs that are in Jetson boards), this value should be at most 0\.7 to allow enough free RAM for both f5c and other programmes\.
