# slow5tools

Slow5tools is a simple toolkit for converting (FAST5 <-> SLOW5), compressing, viewing, indexing and manipulating data in SLOW5 format.

**About SLOW5 format:**  
SLOW5 is a new file format for storing signal data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) devices. SLOW5 was developed to overcome inherent limitations in the standard FAST5 signal data format that prevent efficient, scalable analysis and cause many headaches for developers. SLOW5 can be encoded in human-readable ASCII format, or a more compact and efficient binary format (BLOW5) - this is analogous to the seminal SAM/BAM format for storing DNA sequence alignments. The BLOW5 binary format supports  *zlib* (DEFLATE) compression, or other compression methods (see [notes](https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools#notes)), thereby minimising the data storage footprint while still permitting efficient parallel access. Detailed benchmarking experiments have shown that SLOW5 format is an order of magnitude faster and 25% smaller than FAST5.

## Quick start

If you are a Linux user on x86_64 architecture and want to quickly try slow5tools out, download the compiled binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools/releases). For example:
```sh
VERSION=v0.3.0
wget "https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools/releases/download/$VERSION/slow5tools-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-binaries.tar.gz" && tar xvf slow5tools-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-binaries.tar.gz && cd slow5tools-$VERSION/
./slow5tools
```
Binaries should work on most Linux distributions as the only dependency is `zlib` which is available by default on most distroibutions. For compiled binaries to work, your processor must support SSSE3 instructions or higher (processors after 2007 have these) and your operating system must have GLIBC 2.17 or higher (Linux distributions from 2014 onwards typically have this).

You can also use conda to install *slow5tools* as `conda install slow5tools -c bioconda -c conda-forge`.

## Building

### Building a release


Users are recommended to build from the  [latest release](https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools/releases) tar ball. Quick example for Ubuntu :
```sh
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev zlib1g-dev   #install HDF5 and zlib development libraries
VERSION=v0.3.0
wget "https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools/releases/download/$VERSION/slow5tools-$VERSION-release.tar.gz" && tar xvf slow5tools-$VERSION-release.tar.gz && cd slow5tools-$VERSION/
./configure
make
```
The commands to install hdf5 (and zlib) __development libraries__ on some popular distributions :
```sh
On Debian/Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev zlib1g-dev
On Fedora/CentOS : sudo dnf/yum install hdf5-devel zlib-devel
On Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S hdf5
On OS X : brew install hdf5 zlib
```


### Building from GitHub


Building from the Github repository additionally requires `autoreconf` which can be installed on Ubuntu using `sudo apt-get install autoconf automake` (`brew install autoconf automake` on macOS). To build from GitHub:

```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf automake  #install HDF5 and zlib development libraries and autotools
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools
cd slow5tools
autoreconf	# autoreconf --install for macos
./configure
make
```

### Other building options 

- You can optionally enable [*zstd* compression](https://facebook.github.io/zstd) support when building *slow5lib* by invoking `make zstd=1`. This requires __zstd 1.3 or higher development libraries__ installed on your system (*libzstd1-dev* package for *apt*, *libzstd-devel* for *yum/dnf* and *zstd* for *homebrew*). SLOW5 files compressed with *zstd* offer slightly smaller file size and better performance compared to the default *zlib*. However, *zlib* runtime library is available by default on almost all distributions unlike *zstd* and thus files compressed with *zlib* will be more 'portable' (also see [notes](https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools#notes)). 

- *slow5tools* from version 0.3.0 onwards by default requires vector instructions (SSSE3 or higher for Intel/AMD and neon for ARM). If your processor is an ancient processor with no such vector instructions, invoke make as `make no_simd=1`. 

- If you cannot install hdf5 library system wide you can locally build HDF5 (takes ages) and build slow5tools against that:

    ```
    scripts/install-hdf5.sh         # download and compiles HDF5 in the current folder
    ./configure --enable-localhdf5
    make
    ```

    Similarly, to locally build *zstd* and link against that:
    
    ```
    scripts/scripts/install-zstd.sh        # download and compiles HDF5 in the current folder
    ./configure --enable-localzstd
    make
    ```
    
- You can build a docker image as follows.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools && cd slow5tools
	docker build .
	docker run -v /path/to/local/data/data/:/data/ -it :image_id  ./slow5tools 
	```

## Usage

Visit the [man page](https://hasindu2008.github.io/slow5tools/commands.html) for all the commands and options.

### Examples

```sh
# convert a directory of fast5 files into BLOW5 files (default compression) 
slow5tools f2s fast5_dir -d blow5_dir
# convert a single fast5 file into a SLOW5 ASCII
slow5tools f2s file.fast5 -o file.slow5
# convert a directory of fast5 files into BLOW5 files with zstd compression
slow5tools f2s fast5_dir -d blow5_dir -c zstd

# merge all BLOW5 files in a directory into a single BLOW5 file (default compression)
slow5tools merge blow5_dir -o file.blow5

# to view a BLOW5 file in SLOW5 ASCII on standard out
slow5tools view file.blow5 
# Convert a BLOW5 file into SLOW5 ASCII
slow5tools view file.blow5 -o file.slow5
# convert a SLOW5 file to BLOW5 (default compression)
slow5tools view file.slow5 -o file.blow5

# index a slow5/blow5 file
slow5tools index file.blow5

# extract records from a slow5/blow5 file corresponding to given read ids
slow5tools get file.blow5 readid1 readid2 -o output.slow5

# split a BLOW5 file into separate BLOW5 files based on the read groups
slow5tools split file.blow5 -d blow5_dir -g
# split a BLOW5 file (single read group) into separate BLOW5 files such that there are 4000 reads in one file
slow5tools split file.blow5 -d blow5_dir -r 4000

# convert a directory of blow5 files to fast5
slow5tools s2f blow5_dir -d fast5

```

### Notes

*slow5lib* from version 0.3.0 onwards has built in [StreamVByte](https://github.com/lemire/streamvbyte) compression support to enable even smaller file sizes, which is applied to the raw signal by default when producing BLOW5 files.  *zlib* compression is then applied by default to each record. If *zstd* is used instead of *zlib* on top of *StreamVByte*, it is similar to ONT's latest [vbz](https://github.com/nanoporetech/vbz_compression) compression. BLOW5 files compressed with *zstd+StreamVByte* are still about significantly smaller than vbz compressed FAST5 files.
